# Kolhapur Local Guide – Kiro Heroes Week 5

## Problem
Generic AI tools lack local cultural understanding and recommendations.

## Solution
This project builds a hyperlocal AI guide for Kolhapur using Kiro agent steering.

## Key Feature
The agent behavior is controlled using a custom context file `.kiro/product.md`
which teaches the agent local food, language tone, and cultural knowledge.

## Local Focus
- Kolhapur street food
- Local travel spots
- Marathi-influenced responses

## Demo
The application responds as a local Kolhapur guide using predefined local context.
